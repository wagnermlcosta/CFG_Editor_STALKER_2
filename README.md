The "CFG Editor" script is a Python GUI application that allows the user to modify values ​​in .cfg format configuration files. It offers a user-friendly interface with a dark theme, where the user can select a .cfg file, enter a key, and apply mathematical operations (+, -, *, /) on the value associated with that key in the file. It is also possible to replace the value directly, without operation, and limit the modification to a specific range of lines in the file. The program supports switching between English and Portuguese for the interface. In addition, the script handles common errors such as file not selected, missing key or value, invalid values, and division by zero, displaying appropriate messages to the user.
